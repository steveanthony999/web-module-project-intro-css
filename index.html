        Not just a great valley, but a shrine to human foresight, the strength
        of granite, the power of glaciers, the persistence of life, and the
        tranquility of the High Sierra. First protected in 1864, Yosemite
        National Park is best known for its waterfalls, but within its nearly
        1,200 square miles, you can find deep valleys, grand meadows, ancient
        giant sequoias, a vast wilderness area, and much more.

        Fire is a natural and essential part of Yosemite. We manage fire
        carefully and study how it interacts with the park’s ecosystems. This
        blog provides updates about fires in Yosemite. Check for
        <span>current fire restrictions</span>.

        We strongly recommend that you make reservations for lodging, camping,
        and backpacking. You can pay the <span>park entrance fee</span> upon
        arrival (there's no need to pay it in advance).
